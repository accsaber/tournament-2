#
# In order to use HTTPS in development, a self-signed
# certificate can be generated by running the following
# Mix task:
#
#     mix phx.gen.cert
#
# Run `mix help phx.gen.cert` for more information.

#
# If desired, both `http:` and `https:` keys can be
# configured to run both http and https servers on
# different ports.
